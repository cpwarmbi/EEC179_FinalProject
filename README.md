<h1>Description</h1>
Comparison of several regression models ranging from simple, such as Linear, to advanced models, such as CatBoost, on the Boston Housing Data set.

<h3>List of all models:</h3>
  "Linear Regression"
  "Ridge"
  "Lasso"
  "Elastic Net"
  "Decision Tree"
  "Random Forest"
  "Extra Trees"
  "K Nearest Neighbors"
  "Bagging Regressor"
  "Gradient Boosting",
  "XGBoost"
  "CatBoost"
  "AdaBoost"

***Notes:***
* Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all dependencies
* Currently flip-flops between Bagging Regressor and Gradient Boosting as the best model, depending on the data set. Should work on improving this.
* Should add the Neural Network Regressors to the mix and compare performance (may be wise to run these in another script for time purposes and transfer the results)
* I'm tired
