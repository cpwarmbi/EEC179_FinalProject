<h1>Description</h1>
Comparison of several regression models ranging from simple, such as Linear, to advanced models, such as CatBoost, on the Boston Housing Data set.

<h3>List of all models:</h3>
&nbsp;"Linear Regression" \
&nbsp;"Ridge" \
&nbsp;"Lasso" \
&nbsp;"Elastic Net" \
&nbsp;"Decision Tree" \
&nbsp;"Random Forest" \
&nbsp;"Extra Trees" \
&nbsp;"K Nearest Neighbors" \
&nbsp;"Bagging Regressor" \
&nbsp;"Gradient Boosting" \
&nbsp;"XGBoost" \
&nbsp;"CatBoost" \
&nbsp;"AdaBoost" \

**Notes:**
* Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all dependencies
* Currently flip-flops between Bagging Regressor and Gradient Boosting as the best model, depending on the data set. Should work on improving this.
* Should add the Neural Network Regressors to the mix and compare performance (may be wise to run these in another script for time purposes and transfer the results)
* I'm tired
