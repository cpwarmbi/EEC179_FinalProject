<h1>Description</h1>
Comparison of several regression models ranging from simple, such as Linear, to advanced models, such as CatBoost, on the Boston Housing Data set.

<h3>List of all models:</h3>
  "Linear Regression"\n
  "Ridge"\n
  "Lasso"\n
  "Elastic Net"\n
  "Decision Tree"\n
  "Random Forest"\n
  "Extra Trees"\n
  "K Nearest Neighbors"\n
  "Bagging Regressor"\n
  "Gradient Boosting"\n
  "XGBoost"\n
  "CatBoost"\n
  "AdaBoost"\n
\n\n

**Notes:**
* Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all dependencies
* Currently flip-flops between Bagging Regressor and Gradient Boosting as the best model, depending on the data set. Should work on improving this.
* Should add the Neural Network Regressors to the mix and compare performance (may be wise to run these in another script for time purposes and transfer the results)
* I'm tired
